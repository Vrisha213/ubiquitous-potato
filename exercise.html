      <h5 class="card-title">PUSH-UPS</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Get on the floor on all fours, positioning your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.
Extend your legs back so that you are balanced on your hands and toes. Keep your body in a straight line from head to toe without sagging in the middle or arching your back. You can position your feet to be close together or a bit wider depending on what is most comfortable for you.
Before you begin any movement, contract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine. Keep a tight core throughout the entire pushup.2
Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle.
Exhale as you begin contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands to the start position. Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent.<br>Traditional pushups are beneficial for building upper body strength. They work the triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders. When done with proper form, they can also strengthen the lower back and core by engaging (pulling in) the abdominal muscles. Pushups are a fast and effective exercise for building strength.

      <h5 class="card-title">LUNGES</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Start by standing up tall.
Step forward with one foot until your leg reaches a 90-degree angle. Your rear knee should remain parallel to the ground and your front knee shouldn’t go beyond your toes.
Lift your front lunging leg to return to the starting position.
Repeat 10 to 12 reps on one leg, or switch off between legs until you’ve totaled 10 to 12 reps per leg.<br>Lunges increase muscle mass to build up strength and tone your body, especially your core, butt, and legs. Improving your appearance isn't the main benefit of shaping up your body, as you'll also improve your posture and range of motion. Lunges target the following muscles: abdominals.

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">SPLIT</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Kneel on the floor. Step your right foot forward about a foot in front of your left knee, and rotate your right thigh outwardly. Do this by lifting the inner sole away from the floor and resting the foot on the outer heel.
Exhale and lean your torso forward, pressing your fingertips to the floor. Slowly slide your left knee back, straightening the knee and at the same time descending the right thigh toward the floor. Stop straightening the back knee just before you reach the limit of your stretch.Now begin to push the right heel away from your torso. As the front leg straightens, resume pressing the left knee back, and carefully descend the front of the left thigh and the back of the right leg  to the floor. Make sure the center of the right knee points directly up toward the ceiling.Also check to see that the back leg extends straight out of the hip , and that the center of the back kneecap is pressing directly on the floor. Keep the front leg active by extending through the heel and lifting the ball of the foot toward the ceiling. Bring the hands into Anjali Mudra.
 To come out, press your hands to the floor, turn the front leg out slightly, and slowly return the front heel and the back knee to their starting positions. Then reverse the legs and repeat for the same length of time.
<br>
The benefits of being able to do a split are endless.The splits keep you young. Practicing the splits is great for your joint health, flexibility, and balance.
